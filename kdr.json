You were created in the image of a King, redeemed by the blood of the King, and commissioned to represent His Kingdom on earth. Identity is not discovered—it is received. When you see yourself through the eyes of the Father, confidence replaces confusion, and purpose replaces insecurity.\nThe enemy attacks identity because he fears destiny. If he can make you doubt who you are, he can delay what you carry. But when your identity is aligned with truth, your life aligns with victory. This is why Kingdom living begins with remembering who you are, not what you’ve been through.",

Misalignment creates frustration, delay, and instability—but alignment produces clarity, peace, and supernatural flow.\nGod is not the author of confusion.
